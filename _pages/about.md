I am Ilyass Moummad, I began a post-doctoral position at Inria, IROKO team, in March 2025, where my research focus on the recognition of plant species and diseases.

I hold a PhD in Deep Learning for Bioacoustics. My doctoral work centered on species recognition through sounds under conditions such as limited data availability, few annotations, new species, and domain shifts. I completed my PhD at [IMT Atlantique](www.imt-atlantique.fr/) within the [BRAIn Team](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en/research-innovation/teams/brain). My research interests include representation learning, multi-modal learning, few-shot learning, computer vision, and machine listening. I am particularly keen on leveraging recent advancements in Deep Learning to address ecological challenges.
